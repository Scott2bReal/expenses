What happens when the same malicious arguments are passed to the program now?

```
$ ./expense add 0.01 "', '2015-01-01'); DROP TABLE expenses; --"
```

When that command is run, an expense is merely added to the `expenses` table
with an amount of `0.01` and a name of 

`', '2015-01-01'); DROP TABLE expenses;--`
